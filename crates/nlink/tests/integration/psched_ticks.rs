//! Live-kernel verification of the psched tick conversion (#191-#194, #218).
//!
//! The unit tests in `netlink::psched` and the `psched_wire_tests` modules pin
//! the *bytes nlink emits*, computed by hand from iproute2's algorithm. These
//! tests answer the other half of the question: **does the kernel accept
//! them, and does it read back what we wrote?**
//!
//! That distinction matters here more than usual. The tick bugs survived for
//! so long precisely because nlink's writer and reader were wrong in the same
//! direction and agreed with each other. A round-trip through the *kernel* is
//! the only oracle that cannot be fooled that way.
