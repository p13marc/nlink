//! `NETLINK_EXT_ACK` end-to-end — #292.
//!
//! The crate advertises extended-ack parsing as a headline feature:
//! `errno = 22 (EINVAL)` is supposed to arrive as
//! `"attribute IFLA_MTU rejected: value 0 out of range"`. It never did.
//!
//! `NlMsgError::attrs` reads the TLVs at `sizeof(errno) + sizeof(nlmsghdr)`,
//! which is where they live only when the echoed request has been *capped*.
//! `netlink_ack()` caps it only if the socket asked:
//!
//! ```c
//! if (err && !(nlk->flags & NETLINK_F_CAP_ACK))
//!         payload += nlmsg_len(nlh);   /* echo the WHOLE request */
//! else
//!         flags |= NLM_F_CAPPED;
//! ```
//!
//! nlink set `NETLINK_EXT_ACK` and never `NETLINK_CAP_ACK`, so the kernel
//! echoed the whole request and the parser read request bytes instead of
//! attributes. Every `ext_ack` came back `None`.
//!
//! The unit tests could not catch it: they synthesise the *capped* payload,
//! a shape the kernel was never sending us.
//!
//! These tests need the kernel, because the layout is the kernel's.
