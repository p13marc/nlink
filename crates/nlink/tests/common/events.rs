//! Waiting for an event that must arrive.
//!
//! rtnetlink queues a notification on every subscribed socket before it
//! acknowledges the change that caused it. A test that subscribes first
//! and then makes the change on another connection has the event queued
//! by the time that call returns, so an event that never arrives is a
//! bug, not timing — and these helpers fail on it instead of accepting it.
