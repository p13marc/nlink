//! The [`AddressFamily`] newtype for `AF_*` address-family bytes.
//!
//! Used at routing-rule (`rule.rs`) boundaries and adjacent netlink surfaces
//! that speak `AF_*` constants directly. Closes the raw-`u8` family footgun
//! at the type level — `flush_rules_typed(AddressFamily::v4())` cannot be
//! silently mis-called with an unmodelled byte the way `flush_rules(4)` can.
//!
//! Distinct from [`crate::netlink::nftables::types::Family`] — that type
//! speaks `NFPROTO_*` (NFPROTO_INET=1 has no libc equivalent). Mixing the
//! two is a wire-format error; the asymmetric naming is the cost of keeping
//! both visible in the same crate's public namespace.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use nlink::util::AddressFamily;
//!
//! let v4 = AddressFamily::v4();
//! assert_eq!(u8::from(v4), 2); // AF_INET
//!
//! let v6 = AddressFamily::v6();
//! assert_eq!(u8::from(v6), 10); // AF_INET6
//!
//! // Parse a raw byte returned from the kernel:
//! assert_eq!(AddressFamily::from_raw(2), AddressFamily::v4());
//! ```
