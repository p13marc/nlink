//! Uevent re-enumeration: asking the kernel to re-broadcast a
//! device's uevent (#252).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Every other multicast subscriber in nlink can recover from a
//! dropped frame. [`events_with_resync`] takes a factory that
//! re-dumps the subsystem, and on `ENOBUFS` it emits
//! [`ResyncMarker::ResyncStart`], replays the dump, and emits
//! [`ResyncMarker::ResyncEnd`]. That works because every other
//! protocol has a dump command: `RTM_GETLINK`, `NFT_MSG_GETRULE`,
//! `XFRM_MSG_GETSA`.
//!
//! `NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT` has none. It is broadcast-only — there is
//! no `GETUEVENT`, and nothing to put in the factory. A uevent
//! consumer that overflows its receive buffer has, on its own, no path
//! back to truth.
//!
//! The kernel's answer is `/sys/.../uevent`: writing an action to that
//! file makes the kernel re-broadcast the device's uevent. That is all
//! `udevadm trigger` is — a walk over `/sys/**/uevent`. This module
//! wraps that so a uevent consumer can build a resync factory like
//! everyone else.
//!
//! It lives in `util` rather than `netlink` deliberately. The sysfs
//! audit gate (`scripts/audit-sysfs-in-lib.sh`) keeps `/sys` reads out
//! of the protocol layer because they resolve in the *calling
//! process's mount namespace*, not the connection's netns; a sysfs
//! *write* is further still from what belongs there.
//! [`crate::util::ifname`] is the precedent.
//!
//! # Three things that make this sharper than it looks
//!
//! **1. It is a privileged write on an unprivileged stream.** Reading
//! uevents needs no privilege — the broadcast group is open to
//! anyone. Triggering them needs write access to `/sys/.../uevent`,
//! which is root-only. So the recovery path has a *strictly higher*
//! privilege requirement than the stream it repairs, and a monitor
//! running unprivileged will subscribe happily and only discover at
//! `ENOBUFS` time that it cannot recover. Call
//! [`UeventTrigger::can_trigger`] at startup, not at overflow time.
//!
//! **2. The blast radius is the whole machine.** A write to `uevent`
//! broadcasts to *every* listener, not just the caller. On any normal
//! system that means **udevd re-runs its full rule set** for each
//! triggered device: re-applying permissions and ownership, re-running
//! `NAME=`/`SYMLINK=` assignments, re-creating symlinks, and
//! restarting systemd units bound to the device. This is not a
//! read-only recovery step; it perturbs the host. Hence the default
//! action is [`TriggerAction::Change`] rather than `Add` (`add` tells
//! udev the device is new), and hence [`UeventTrigger::device`] —
//! one device — is the ergonomic path while
//! [`UeventTrigger::subtree`] makes you name a root and hands back a
//! summary of what it touched.
//!
//! **3. It is best-effort re-announcement, not a snapshot.** The
//! dump-based resyncs elsewhere in the crate are *consistent*:
//! `RTM_GETLINK` returns the kernel's state at one point in time. A
//! trigger is not that. It asks the kernel to re-emit events, which
//! then race with live events on the same socket, can themselves be
//! dropped if the buffer is still under pressure, and describe the
//! device *at re-emission time* rather than at the moment of the
//! event that was lost. See [`resync_factory`] for what that means for
//! the `ResyncedEvent` contract.
//!
//! [`events_with_resync`]: crate::netlink::resync::events_with_resync
//! [`ResyncMarker::ResyncStart`]: crate::netlink::resync::ResyncMarker::ResyncStart
