//! Joining rtnetlink and uevents into one typed netdev lifecycle
//! (#253).
//!
//! nlink has two independent views of a network device coming into
//! existence, and neither is complete:
//!
//! * **rtnetlink** (`RTM_NEWLINK` / `RTM_DELLINK`) knows the ifindex,
//!   the flags, the MTU, the master, the kind — everything in the
//!   `IFLA_*` namespace. It knows nothing about the sysfs path or the
//!   bus parent.
//! * **uevents** know the devpath (and through it the bus parent), the
//!   `DEVTYPE=` for kinds that set one, the `SEQNUM=`, and the
//!   `add`/`move`/`remove` lifecycle. They carry no link attributes at
//!   all.
//!
//! What net uevents do **not** carry is the driver. `DRIVER=` is a
//! general uevent key, but `dev_uevent()` adds it only for a device
//! that has a driver bound, and a net-class device never does — the
//! driver binds to the *bus* device (PCI, virtio, USB) underneath it.
//! That device's uevents are `SUBSYSTEM=pci`/`virtio`/…, go only to
//! the initial network namespace, and carry no `IFINDEX=`, so there is
//! no key to join them on. Measured across veth, dummy, bridge, vlan
//! and a virtio NIC: `DRIVER=` never appeared (#328). The recipe table
//! and this module said otherwise until 0.27; [`NetdevInfo::driver`]
//! is kept for a kernel or driver that does emit it, and is `None` in
//! practice.
//!
//! What makes the join tractable is that net-subsystem uevents carry
//! `IFINDEX=` and `INTERFACE=`: the two sources share a primary key.
//! [`NetdevLifecycle`] merges them into one [`NetdevEvent`] stream, and
//! optionally mirrors the result into a [`Store<u32, NetdevInfo>`] for
//! a watch-cache of fully attributed devices.
//!
//! # The four decisions this design rests on
//!
//! ## 1. rtnetlink is authoritative for existence; uevents annotate
//!
//! The kernel gives no ordering guarantee between the `RTM_NEWLINK` on
//! one socket and the matching `add@` uevent on another — either can
//! land first. Three ways out were on the table: emit on whichever
//! arrives first and follow up; buffer with a join window; or make one
//! side authoritative.
//!
//! This takes the third, with the first as its follow-up rule. A
//! device exists when rtnetlink says so, and [`NetdevEvent::Added`]
//! carries whatever annotation had already arrived — possibly none.
//! When the uevent half lands afterwards, it surfaces as a
//! [`NetdevEvent::Changed`] with the enriched
//! [`NetdevInfo`]. Buffering was rejected because it needs a latency
//! knob *and* a "the partner never arrived" timeout — and the partner
//! genuinely may never arrive: a device whose uevent predates the
//! subscription has no second announcement coming.
//!
//! The crack in the model is `bind`/`unbind`, which have no rtnetlink
//! counterpart at all. Those are emitted as
//! [`NetdevEvent::DriverBound`] / [`NetdevEvent::DriverUnbound`]
//! without requiring an rtnetlink partner. Read them as annotations of
//! a device's driver state, never as statements about whether the
//! device exists — and expect not to see them: `KOBJ_BIND`/`KOBJ_UNBIND`
//! fire on the bus device that binds the driver, which is not the net
//! device and carries no `IFINDEX=`, so a `subsystem("net")` stream
//! has no bind to join (#328).
//!
//! ## 2. ifindex reuse is handled by name cross-check, not by trust
//!
//! Kernel ifindexes are recycled. A stale uevent for a dead ifindex
//! can arrive after a new device has claimed the same number, and a
//! join keyed on ifindex alone would silently attribute it to the
//! wrong device.
//!
//! Two things prevent that. An annotation is dropped when the device
//! is removed, so a recycled index starts clean. And because net
//! uevents carry `INTERFACE=`, an annotation held for an ifindex that
//! then turns up as a *new* device under a different name is discarded
//! as stale rather than attached.
//!
//! The name check is deliberately applied only on the
//! [`Added`](NetdevEvent::Added) transition. A rename emits both an
//! `RTM_NEWLINK` and a `move` uevent, and their order is not fixed —
//! enforcing the check on every event would throw away good
//! annotations during a rename. [`NetdevInfo::is_fully_attributed`]
//! reports whether the annotation's name currently agrees with
//! rtnetlink's, so a caller that wants to be strict can be.
//!
//! ## 3. The devpath is carried, never resolved
//!
//! `DEVPATH=` names a path in sysfs, and sysfs resolves in the calling
//! process's **mount** namespace — while the ifindex resolves in the
//! connection's **network** namespace. They are not the same
//! namespace, and nothing in this module may pretend otherwise. So
//! [`NetdevAnnotation::devpath`] is the string the kernel sent and
//! nothing more; this module never opens it. Resolving it is the
//! caller's business, in `util` (see
//! [`crate::util::uevent_trigger`]), under the caller's namespace
//! assumptions. The `scripts/audit-sysfs-in-lib.sh` CI gate enforces
//! the same rule mechanically.
//!
//! ## 4. Inside a namespace you see net uevents and nothing else
//!
//! Net-device uevents are delivered to the network namespace of the
//! listening socket. Uevents for every other subsystem go only to the
//! initial namespace. So a `NetdevLifecycle` running inside a netns
//! sees exactly what it needs and nothing more — but do not expect the
//! PCI-parent uevent of a device passed into that namespace to turn
//! up. It won't.
//!
//! # Frame loss
//!
//! Either side can drop frames under burst. The rtnetlink side has a
//! dump to recover from, if you hand the join a **resync stream**
//! ([`Connection::<Route>::into_events_with_resync`]) rather than plain
//! `events()`. The join takes the snapshot the stream opens with and the
//! one after every overflow: a device in a snapshot is `Added` or
//! `Changed`, and a device the join knew that a snapshot lacks is
//! `Removed`. Fed a plain stream, an overflow loses whatever link events
//! it dropped — a `DelLink` among them leaves a device the join, and its
//! store, keep for good (#510).
//!
//! The uevent side has no dump to resync from (#252) — an annotation
//! lost that way stays lost until the device is re-announced. Size the
//! receive buffer (which [`Connection::<KobjectUevent>::new`] now does)
//! and prefilter the stream ([`crate::netlink::uevent_filter`]) so it
//! doesn't come to that. So with a resync stream, a cache built from
//! this join can be missing *annotations* but not *devices*.
//!
//! [`Connection::<KobjectUevent>::new`]: crate::netlink::Connection::new
//! [`Connection::<Route>::into_events_with_resync`]: crate::netlink::Connection::into_events_with_resync
